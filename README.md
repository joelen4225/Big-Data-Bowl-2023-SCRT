# Big-Data-Bowl-2023-SCRT
This is all the code our team used for our 2023 Big Data Bowl Submission. Based on the way we gave out tasks, the offense code is mainly in Python and the defense code is mainly in R. If you choose to mimic the code, you will need to ubpdate destinations of input files. Thank you and also check out our Kaggle notebook on the project.
